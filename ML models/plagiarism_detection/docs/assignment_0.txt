Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud Hub which has been launched to empower the next generation of students with AI-ready skills. The company will provide AI development tools and Azure AI services like Microsoft Cognitive Services, Bot Services and Azure Machine Learning. According to Manish Prakash, Country General Manager-PS, Health and Education, Microsoft India, said, "With AI being the defining technology of our time, it is transforming lives and industry and the jobs of tomorrow will require a different skillset. This will require more collaborations and training and working with AI. Thatâ€™s why it has become more critical than ever for educational institutions to integrate new cloud and AI technologies. The program is an attempt to ramp up the institutional set-up and build capabilities among the educators to educate the workforce of tomorrow." The program aims to build up the cognitive skills and in-depth understanding of developing intelligent cloud connected solutions for applications across industry. Earlier in April this year, the company announced Microsoft Professional Program In AI as a learning track open to the public. The program was developed to provide job ready skills to programmers who wanted to hone their skills in AI and data science with a series of online courses which featured hands-on labs and expert instructors as well.
